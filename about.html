  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Saahera and I am a current senior at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School in the Web Development shop. I have used the skills I have learned in the past three years to make this site to compile all the work I've done since we have started. I was not interested in computer science before I joined this class and now it has made me realize that I want to do this as a career. I continue to use the skills I have learned on a daily basis and will use them throughout my career. </p>
